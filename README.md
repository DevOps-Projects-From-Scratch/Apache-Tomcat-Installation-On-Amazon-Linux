## Overview of Tomcat:
* Apache Tomcat, commonly referred to as Tomcat it is developed using the Java programming language.
* Apache Tomcat is an open-source web server and servlet container used for hosting Java web applications.
* It provides an environment to run Java Servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSPs) and is known for its simplicity and lightweight nature.

## Prerequisites:
* Apache Tomcat runs on port 8080 by default, so port 8080 must be open on EC2 Security Group.
* Java to be installed it can be JDK (Java Development Kit) or JRE (Java Runtime Environment) 
* Version of Java to be installed depends upon Tomcat version. 
* You can look for it here https://tomcat.apache.org/whichversion.html 

## RAM and hard disk requirements: 
* The RAM and hard disk requirements for Apache Tomcat can vary depending on the specific version of Tomcat, the size and complexity of the applications being deployed, and the expected workload.
### RAM Requirements:
* For basic testing or development purposes, a minimum of 1 GB of RAM is typically sufficient.
* For small-scale or low-traffic production environments, a minimum of 2-4 GB of RAM is recommended.
* For medium to large-scale deployments or high-traffic environments, you should consider allocating 8 GB or more of RAM. 
* The exact amount will depend on factors such as the number of concurrent users, the size and complexity of deployed applications, and any additional services running on the server.
### Hard Disk Requirements:
* The base installation of Apache Tomcat requires around 200-300 MB of disk space.
* Additional disk space will be needed for storing web applications, logs, and any other data generated by Tomcat.
* The amount of disk space required will depend on the size and number of deployed applications and the volume of log data generated.
